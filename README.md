### Summary: 

A tragedy about a character that has been seperated from their love interest for most of their life, but as the world ends around them (apocalypse: virus) for some reason they manage to force their way out of their bindings, only to spend their last precious moments together. 

### Story Outline:

**Beginning** - Person Assigned: Sam  

**Buildup** - Person Assigned: William    

It turned out Timothy was able to win some money at a casino playing the slots at a casino and with the $15,000.00 he had won, he had rushed to buy a plane ticket in hopes of applying for a visa to go to the war-bound country in East Africa. Tim then realized that he would not able to gain a tourist visa on arrivial so he was super confused and upset. He had been eager to contact his intimate partner whom he had lost contact with. 

Things had became better for Tim because he was fortunate enough to visit his partner twice in her country before the virus terrorized the entire earth. So Tim was aware on how to locate Rachel from his past visits to her country. Tim was very worried because things was not great in Rachel's country either.  Tim finally tried to apply online for a visa but the website was down for maintenance. 

A month went by with Tim eagerly searching for answers from an immigration attorney on how to apply for a visa thru the Embassy but because the embassy was not allowing walk in visits, it was difficult. But By surprise, Tim went back to check the online visa website which was open now for visa applications and in less then two days, they sent Tim an 90 day visa to return to Rachel, his future wife - hopefully soon.
