# IT115-GROUP2
Repo for Group 2's IT 115 Branch Pull Merge Repeat Project

Storyline (in progress): A tragedy about a character that has been seperated from their love interest for most of their life, but as the world ends around them (apocalypse: virus) for some reason they manage to force their way out of their bindings, only to spend their last precious moments together. 

Wireframe of Story:

Beginning - Person Assigned: Sam  

The year was 2120 and the virus had spread across the world like wildfire. Life for human beings was slowly coming to an inevitable end and they all knew it. Those who were fortunate enough to still be alive spent their days rummaging through deteriorating buildings and empty houses in search of whatever they could find to sustain them. Timothy Gray sat in an abandoned grocery store and stared at a picture in his wallet. He did it for her, she was the love of his life. The only thing that kept him going was the thought of being reunited with her, to spend the final moments on earth with her. It was all he wanted, for he hadn’t seen her since before the virus started. The last conversation they had was after the world went into a quarantine. They spoke over walkie talkies, and he’s held onto it over the years in hopes of hearing her voice one last time.

He rummaged through his backpack, pulling out his old walkie talkie. Holding the walkie talkie brought back memories of their long-ago late-night conversations and a small smile made its way onto his face. There were limited ways to contact her, what with the lack of internet or cell service, so walkie talkie it was. She might have just thrown hers away, and if she hadn’t, what was the chance that she had hers turned on too?      

“Still, it wouldn’t hurt to try,” Timothy thought. He made sure it was on and tuned to their channel before clearing his throat and pressing down on the transmit button.      

“Is anyone there? Over,” he spoke into the walkie talkie. Static. He repeated the cycle a few more times and was about to give up when he heard some muffled sounds.        

“Who’s there? Over,” said a feminine voice. He recognized that voice!       

“It’s me, Timothy. Is that you, (Name)? Over.”      

“It is! Is that really you Timothy? Why-I can’t believe this is the way we’re talking to each other again,” she laughed. He missed her laugh. No- he missed her. He would’ve never imagined that an apocalypse is what it would take to get them speaking to each other again. Over their old walkie talkies, they caught up and reminisced about their past. It didn’t take long before they were planning to meet. After all in an apocalypse where the world was slowly dying, having company was more comfortable than wandering alone.       

They agreed to meet up in a deserted neighborhood he had found on one of his outings. They both needed to be prepared because it would be a dangerous journey. After the virus had broken out, chaos had taken place. People took advantage of the panic and disorderliness that resulted from the news of the virus. Stores were getting looted, buildings were on fire, and violence prevailed. At times like this, people were their own worst enemy.

End - Person Assigned: Austin  

With everything collapsing, Timothy drew ragged breaths, their feet sore from running. Sore soles and screaming out in his mind, he saw the silhouette of his love illuminated by the flames behind them. Reinvigorated by the sight, he continued to run reaching for that fragment of a desired life. And out of nowhere, they embraced. Soft hands combing through Timothy's hair and his heavy breathing began to slow. Looking up with his tired eyes to the face he had missed for who knows how long, tears streamed as he felt joy for the first time in ages. Though everything around them grew more and more unstable, he was happy, and so too was their love. Their words lost in the torrent, nothing could convey they euphoria they felt together for the first and last time. But for however long it was, the two were able to live happily ever after.
